Integer columns in Python cannot represent missing values. If your input data contains missing values at inference time, it will be encoded as floats and will cause a schema enforcement error. The best way to avoid this problem is to infer the model schema based on a realistic data sample (training dataset) that includes missing values. Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values. See `Handling Integers With Missing Values <https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#handling-integers-with-missing-values>`_ for more details.\n  warnings.warn(\n2025/12/15 17:11:56 WARNING mlflow.utils.requirements_utils: Found pyspark version (4.0.0+databricks.connect.17.2.2) contains a local version label (+databricks.connect.17.2.2).
